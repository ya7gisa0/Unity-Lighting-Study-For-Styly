# Unity-Lighting-Study-for-Styly

{Styly](https://suite.styly.cc/) is a VR platform for all kinds of creatives. You could create beautiful VR spaces without any coding. I highly recommend you to sign up if you haven't. Realise your imagination ;)

Currently, the default lighting is not good then I just wanted to explore lights could make the scene look better in VR. You can upload your custom light objects with the plugin available free [here](https://suite.styly.cc/download/).

Overall, the default value of Shadow Strength is set to 1, which is in monst cases too strong. I have tried several values for that and I personally prefer 0.5~0.7 for better shadows. Below there are more specific descriptions for different types of lights.

### Directional Lights
- the default color seems ok
- the intensity value would change dramatically based on what kind of scene you want to make

### Point Lights

### Spot Lights
